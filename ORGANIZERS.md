# HelpQ for Organizers/Volunteers

## What is HelpQ
HelqQ is kind of like a virtual line that people can wait in to get help from mentors.
but since its virtual hackers can continue hacking and wait for mentors to come to them.

## The Process
anyone with an Account on hackru.org can login to HelpQ. users can be manually added if needed.
1. hacker logs into HelpQ
2. hacker fills out ticket explaining their issue, where they are and how to contact them. by default tickets last for 1 hour.
2.5. optionally hackers can rescind their ticket if they figure it out
3. Mentor logs in and sees tickets in the Q
4. Mentor Claims a ticket and tries to find/get in contact with the hacker. HelpQ implies the existence of slack for mentors and hackers to communicate, it also shows a map of the venue and has the rooms.
5. Mentor mentors the mentee.
6. Mentor closes the ticket on HelpQ
7. Hacker optionally gives feedback for the ticket.

## Adding mentors
By default when users log in they are not marked as mentors for obvious reasons. if a mentor already has an account on hackru.org they can be directed to log in and will appear in the admin panel.
from the admin panel a volunteer or organizer. once mentors/volunteers/organizers go off shift they can have their role revoked through the admin panel.

## Administration
HelpQ has a few administration tasks that can be done from the admin panel
- adding users manually
- setting a mentor's slack
- getting stats on what kind of tickets people are submitting
- setting the ticket expiration
- closing the Q so no more tickets can be filled (useful if swamped with tickets)

If a Hacker comes to the table saying that the mentor hasn't found them you should be able to see which mentor claimed their ticket in the admin panel and track them down. Likewise you have hackers emails so if a hacker goes MIA and the contact info they were forced to provide doesn't work, then they could potentially be looked up in LCS. but if they don't come to the mentor table then the issue probably wouldn't be serious enough to warrant that

## Notes
There should probably be someone at the mentor table with admin access at all times, unless the mentor table is closed. In cause there are issues I Will provide some Paper backup forms additional copies may need to be made. I will provide my phone number in the event there is an issue and I can't be found. If you think I'm asleep then wake me up, I live on college ave And I'll likely be there almost the whole event. In the event we need to go to paper backup I will have forms on standby  at the mentor table. The form is also [here](https://github.com/HackRU/helpq/blob/master/paperBackup.pdf) on github and the process will be very similar to the online one, but with paper.
