Contributing to HELPq
=====================

Thank you for using HELPq, and we're really excited that you want to help out!

Development Process
-------------------

This project is a fork of the MIT HELPq and we try to pull any changes from them to get new features. There is a group on the HackRU Discord dedicated to work on this project and feel free to @ the project lead @(Mickey J)
meetings are probably saturday

Pull Requests
-------------

We actively welcome your pull requests!

However, before you begin, please create an issue so we can determine if the work, feature, or bugfix either has someone already working on it as a part of the current roadmap, or if the feature is not something that would belong in HELPq in a HackRU context, or should even be bumped up to MIT's HELPq for more general use.

there should probably be only one pull request per issue and similar issues should be merged if it makes sence to do a pull request for both.

each pull request should also have atleast one reviewer.

This is mostly meant for discussion, so we can discuss things fully and make a really awesome product :)

Issues
------

We use issues to track public bugs. Please make sure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

We also use issues to track feature requests and discuss. Please mark your issue as 'Feature Request' in this case!


Coding Style
------------

Keep it clean, and try to stay away from jank :)
