As a hacker, I Don't want to be sitting at a table waiting for a mentor to help
with my issue when I could be at the table with my team working on our hack. It
Would be nice to have a system where I can submit my issue and countinue work.
And a mentor will come find me when they're ready

-----------------------------------------------
As a mentor I don't want to be bombarded with tickets. I want to be able to take
my time helping people and then find another person once I'm ready to help a new
person. and my phone won't constantly vibrate while I'm trying to eat

it would be nice for the feed to update in real time so I don't have to refresh
to get new tickets.

-----------------------------------------------
As an organiser I'd like to know about
- what kinds of questions people
- are peoples questions getting answered
- how do hackers feel about this system

I'd also like to be able to close the system to new requests If there are no
mentors to answer. and I'd like to be able to controll the expiration of tickets
so that tickets don't staty open forever, unanswered.
